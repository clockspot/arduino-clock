// These are the legacy RLB board connections to Arduino analog input pins.
// S1/PL13 = Reset
// S2/PL5 = A1
// S3/PL6 = A0
// S4/PL7 = A6
// S5/PL8 = A3
// S6/PL9 = A2
// S7/PL14 = A7
// A6-A7 are analog-only pins that aren't quite as responsive and require a physical pullup resistor (1K to +5V), and can't be used with rotary encoders because they don't support pin change interrupts.
